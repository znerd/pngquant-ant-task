This is pngquant-ant-task, an Apache Ant task for quantizing PNG images.
Image quantization is the process of the reducing the number of colors in an
image. Under the hood this task uses (and requires) pngquant, see:

   http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngquant.html

This Ant task has been tested with the following combination of software:

   - J2SE 5.0 and Java SE 6 (source code uses Java 5-features)
   - Ant 1.7.1
   - pngquant 1.0

This software is available under the terms of a BSD-style license, see
the accompanied LICENSE file.

This task comes as a collection of Java source files that can be built with
Ant. To compile the Java classes, run all available unit tests and build the
JAR file run:

   ant

Note that this already requires 'pngquant' on the PATH. The result will be a
JAR file:

   build/pngquant-ant-task.jar

If you don't have 'pngquant' installed and still want to build the JAR file,
just execute:

   ant jar

This will skip the execution of the available unit tests.

Example usage of the task in an Ant build file:

   <taskdef name="pngquant"
       classname="com.pensioenpage.jynx.pngquant.PngquantTask"
       classpath="lib/pngquant-ant-task.jar" />

   <pngquant dir="src/htdocs" todir="build/htdocs" />

Although all parameters are optional, the task supports various:

   method    - the quantization algoritm to apply, either "ordered" or
               "diffusion" (Floyd-Steinberg); the default is "ordered";

   colors    - the maximum number of colors, must not exceed 256, minimum is
               2; the default is 256;

   process   - flag that indicates if the input files should be processed at
               all; there are 3 possible modes:

                  "yes" - the files must be processed by pngquant, if at least
                          one file could not be processed, then this task will
                          fail (alternative is "true");

                  "no"  - the files must not be processed by pngquant but must
                          instead just be copied as-is, unchanged (alternative
                          is "false");

                  "try" - attempt to process all matching file(s), when a file
                          fails to be processed, then copy the original file
                          instead.

   dir       - the source directory, to read PNG image files from, defaults to
               the project base directory;

   todir     - the destination directory, to write the produced PNG files to,
               defaults to the source directory;

   overwrite - when set this flag forces each existing output file to be
               overwritten, even if it is newer than the respective source
               file; defaults to 'no';

   command   - the command to execute, by default the task uses 'pngquant';

   timeOut   - the time-out in milliseconds for executing a single command,
               defaults to 60000 (meaning 60 seconds);

   includes  - the files in the source directory to include, defaults to all
               files, although only those that end in '.png' will actually
               be optimized or copied;

   excludes  - the files to exclude, even if they are matched by the includes;

and other parameters inherited from the MatchingTask, see:
